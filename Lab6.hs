-- Lab 6:  FSM constructions for regular operators

import Data.List
import Data.Array
import Control.Monad (replicateM)  -- for strings function below

-- Fixed alphabet, but everything below should work for any sigma!
sigma :: [Char]
sigma = "ab"

-- All strings on sigma of length <= n (useful for testing)
strings :: Int -> [String]
strings n = concat $ [replicateM i sigma | i <- [0..n]]

-- Finite state machines, now indexed by the type of their states
-- M = (states, start, finals, transitions)  
type FSM a = ([a], a, [a], a -> Char -> a)

---------------- Your solution to Lab 5, ported to FSM a -------------------




---------------- Some additional useful functions --------------------------

-- Normalize a list: sort and remove duplicates
norm :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
norm xs = rad $ sort xs where
  rad :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]  -- Remove adjacent duplicates
  rad [] = []
  rad [x] = [x]
  rad (x:ys@(y:zs)) | x == y = rad ys
                    | otherwise = x : rad ys

-- Cartesian product (preserves normalization)
(><) :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
xs >< ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]

-- Powerset  (preserves normalization)
power :: [a] -> [[a]]
power [] = [[]]
power (x:xs) = let ys = power xs
               in [] : map (x:) ys ++ tail ys

-- Check whether two lists overlap
overlap :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
overlap [] ys = False
overlap (x:xs) ys = elem x ys || overlap xs ys


---------------- Lab 6 begins here -----------------------------------------

-- Complete the FSM constructions for the regular expression operators
